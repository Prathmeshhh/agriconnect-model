    <li class="scheme">Soil Health Card Scheme</li>
    <p>
      The foundation of India is based on agriculture. Cultivation not only
      feeds the millions living in the country but also earns foreign exchange
      via export. To ensure that the farmers make a good profit, maintaining a
      high level of soil fertility is required. The government has thus
      implemented the Soil Health Card Scheme. The program will provide the
      farmers with the chance of knowing about the fertility level of the soil
      on their land holdings.<br /><br />

    <li class="scheme">National Agriculture Market</li>
    <p>
      The idea behind this National Agriculture Market (NAM) is to make sure
      that all people involved in agriculture must know about the price for the
      product which they are selling in rest of the India and how well it is
      being trending in both price and quantity. If agriculturalists are very
      well informed about these details, they can now make their pricing
      decision in an opt manner and make sure that they are deciding their own
      selling price rather than going with the decision that is made by a third
      party.<br /><br />
